In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build from scratch a fullstack Web3 dApp with the ASS stack.

You do not need any Rust experience to follow this guide, but it would be helpful to have a general understanding of how dApps work at least from a user‚Äôs perspective (all that _connect wallet_, _approve transaction_ kind of stuff).

I‚Äôll skip the further mumbling on why ASS stack is thicc because it is self-evident. Let‚Äôs dive straight in!

## Preview of our app

We are building an app called ‚Äúgm Solana‚Äù - a guest book app where users can log in with their Solana wallets and drop a ‚Äú[gm](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gm-good-morning)‚Äù to their [frens](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fren).

Although the app is simple, you will be able to understand intuitively how Solana apps work, and get a hands-on experience with the most important skills and concepts developing a fullstack Solana dApp - the typical workflow, read and write blockchain data, connect the blockchain with your frontend app, authentication, etc.

## Our tech stack

First, let's have a look at what the ASS stack covers:

- [**Anchor**](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/introduction.html) - The de facto high-level framework for Solana
- [**Solana**](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) - The reason why are you reading this
- [**Svelte**](https://svelte.dev/) - A blazing fast frontend framework (actually it‚Äôs a compiler), an alternative to React
- [üçë](https://emojipedia.org/peach/)¬†- The peach emoji, which is often associated with the word ‚Äúass‚Äù

In addition, we‚Äôll also integrate our app with:

- [**Phantom**](https://phantom.app/) - An awesome Solana browser wallet
- **[@solana/web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/)** - The Javascript library bridging client-side and the Solana network
- [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Frankly, I just can‚Äôt work with Javascript... Besides, most Solana tutorial available right now are written in JS, and to get everything working with TS sometimes needs some extra effort, so I hope this tutorial proves helpful

I‚Äôll also be using **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**. If you haven‚Äôt done it yet, you need to install the [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) and [Rust](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust) extensions to follow along this tutorial.

## Step 0. Install and set up Solana

Before we start, you need to install the necessary tools. M1 Macs used to have some issues setting things up for the Solana Tool Suite, but now there is an official binary build for the M1 architecture, so the process has become pretty straightforward.

### Install Rust

First, you will need to install the Rust toolchain.

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup component add rustfmt
```

![Install Rust](https://i.imgur.com/M1bIux8.png)

### Install Solana Tool Suite

To install Solana, you can simply run the installation script. I‚Äôm specifying to install [v1.9.4](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/tag/v1.9.4):

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.9.4/install)"
```

![Install Solana Tool Suite](https://i.imgur.com/1Dj2iWB.png)

Note that if you are using zsh, you need to update your PATH.

After it is finished, you can verify if the installation is successful with the following command.

```bash
solana --version
```

Now, you can run the test validator (a local testnet) to see if everything works correctly with command `solana-test-validator`.

![Solana version check](https://i.imgur.com/2nIBADv.png)

Let‚Äôs stop the test validator for now and move on!

### Install Anchor

Anchor is the recommended framework for Solana programs.

Note that Anchor uses [Yarn v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) to manage Javascript dependencies in your project, so make sure you already have it installed on your computer.

Let‚Äôs build the Rust code from source, it‚Äôs pretty straightforward:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor --tag v0.20.1 anchor-cli --locked
```

Then, you can verify if the installation is successful with:

```bash
anchor --version
```

![Install Anchor](https://i.imgur.com/F4ffirh.png)

### Install Phantom Wallet

The Phantom Wallet is a browser extension that takes care of connecting your Solana wallet and the dApp you are visiting, as well as the Solana blockchain. You can get it from [their official website](https://phantom.app/download) and follow their instruction to set it up.

If you have used MetaMask with EVM compatible networks before, you are then already familiar with how it works.

![Install Phantom Wallet](https://i.imgur.com/1EQTPGF.png)

And that‚Äôs it. Let‚Äôs have some real fun!

## Step 1. Create an Anchor project - gm Solana!

### gm-solana

To kick off, use Anchor to initialize a project and open it in VS Code:

```bash
anchor init gm-solana
cd gm-solana
code .
```

![Initialize gm-solana](https://i.imgur.com/KdojPjm.png)

What we‚Äôve got here are some config files and a few subdirectories:

- app - where our client-side Svelte app will be
- migrations - deployment scripts
- programs - smart contracts
- tests - the name says it all ;)

### Set up keys

If you haven‚Äôt played with Solana on this machine yet, you will need to run `solana-keygen new` to generate a new key. The passphrase can be empty.

The new key is saved at `~/.config/solana/id.json`.

![solana-keygen new](https://i.imgur.com/7IC8677.png)

You can also use the key generated from your Phantom wallet, but I‚Äôm just going to use separate ones in this tutorial for clarity.

### Configure Solana to use localhost

Next, run the following commands to set the network to localhost, and check the current settings:

```
solana config set --url localhost
solana config get
```

![Configure Solana to use localhost](https://i.imgur.com/9cYsh2E.png)

Later we will see how to push your app to devnet or mainnet.

### Test and verify project setup

Now, you can run `anchor build` to test build the default example project Anchor created.

![anchor build](https://i.imgur.com/5z910NB.png)

Building works! Now, run `anchor test` to see if tests pass too.

![anchor test](https://i.imgur.com/ULuZjvN.png)

The `anchor test` command does a bunch in one go - it spins up the test validator, deploys the build, and runs the test cases against the deployments. Pretty handy!

## Step 2. Anatomy of an Anchor program

### Programs and Accounts

In Solana, there‚Äôs a clear separation of logic (programs) and state (accounts). This is very different from Ethereum where contracts hold state themselves.

Users store data in accounts, Solana programs store data in accounts, the code instructions themselves are also stored in accounts. If your program wants some state stored, it will have to reach out to some accounts outside, everything is passed by reference.

### Overview of the ‚Äúhello world‚Äù example

Anchor is like the backend web framework for Solana, like Ruby on Rails, Express, or Flask. It really abstracts away a lot of the low level stuff so that you can focus on just designing logic and data structure.

Before we delete the ‚Äúhello world‚Äù app that Anchor generated for us, let‚Äôs have a look at it first.

The magic all happens in the `programs/gm-solana/src/lib.rs` file, that‚Äôs the entrance of our program.

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod gm_solana {
    use super::*;
    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> ProgramResult {
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize {}
```

Let‚Äôs break it down:

### **Preamble**

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");
```

These two lines basically imports the Rust libraries needed here and hardcodes the address where your program will be deployed to (it needs to be predefined for security reasons).

### **Program and instruction handlers**

```rust
#[program]
pub mod gm_solana {
    use super::*;
    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> ProgramResult {
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

This section is where our logic is defined.

The `#[program]` is a [Rust macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#macros) that abstracts away the boilerplate and extra code needed to make your Rust program an Anchor program.

The functions here are very similar to request handlers in server-side web frameworks. And, this is exactly what all these Web3 things are about - they replace the web servers from the traditional, centralized web!

We can see that the `initialize` instruction handler takes in a context `ctx`, which has the type of `Context` of struct `Initialize`. What a mouthful!

Remember that we said everything is passed by reference into the program, if the program wants to access and manipulate state? Well, that‚Äôs because of the parallel nature of Solana‚Äôs executions and how all programs are stateless.

When we want to call a function on a program, we need to provide all the accounts in advance (aka. all the data that might be needed for a function to perform some tasks).

This `ctx` thing basically contains all those references, and it uses some Rust magic to constrain the types of accounts that can be passed in, below in the account constraints part.

### **Account constraints**

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize {}
```

We don‚Äôt have much going on here in this ‚Äúhello world‚Äù program, but we‚Äôll see more in our ‚Äúgm Solana‚Äù app below. What this section does is to enforce that the context passed into the instruction handler has the correct accounts.

Our ‚Äúgm Solana‚Äù program is more complex, let‚Äôs dive into it!

## Step 3. Implement ‚Äúgm Solana‚Äù

### Understand what we need to do

Now we know what accounts and programs in Solana are, and how an Anchor app looks like. Let‚Äôs see what we need exactly for our ‚Äúgm Solana‚Äù guest book app to work:

- some state to store all those gm‚Äôs (specifically - message content, sender, and timestamp)
- a program to access that state and add new gm‚Äôs when needed
- a bunch of functions aka. instruction handlers on that program to do the actual work

Sounds good, let‚Äôs go!

### Define data structure

Let‚Äôs start with data structures first, then move on to the logic parts.

First, we need to store the program state somewhere. Let‚Äôs define a `BaseAccount` with exactly what we want to store - `gm_count` is an unsigned 64bit integer, and `gm_list` is a [vector](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html) (a growable array) of `GmMessage` objects, which contain the message and some metadata.

```rust
#[account]
pub struct BaseAccount {
    pub gm_count: u64,
    pub gm_list: Vec<GmMessage>,
}

// define a struct called GmMessage that contains a message, sender, and timestamp
#[derive(Clone, Debug, AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize)]
pub struct GmMessage {
    pub message: String,
    pub user: Pubkey,
    pub timestamp: i64,
}
```

The `BaseAccount` is marked under the `#[account]` macro, and because Solana works with specific kinds of data structures, we have to use the macro `#[derive(Clone, Debug, AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize)]` here.

### **Program and instruction handlers**

Now, let‚Äôs write the program logic. We need two functions - first one is to initialize a `base_account`, set the initial values to 0, then another one is to handle the client‚Äôs request to `say_gm`.

We‚Äôll declare the context structs / account constraints right after.

```rust
#[program]
pub mod gm_solana {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> ProgramResult {
        // &mut means we are letting the compiler know that we are mutating this value
        let base_account = &mut ctx.accounts.base_account;

        base_account.gm_count = 0;

        Ok(())
    }

    // receive a message and store it into gm_list with some metadata
    pub fn say_gm(ctx: Context<SayGm>, message: String) -> ProgramResult {
        let base_account = &mut ctx.accounts.base_account;

        // grab a copy of the input data
        let message = message.clone();
        // get the current Solana network time
        let timestamp = Clock::get().unwrap().unix_timestamp;
        // grab the public key of the transaction sender
        // * dereferences the pointer
        let user = *ctx.accounts.user.to_account_info().key;

        let gm = GmMessage {
            user,
            message,
            timestamp,
        };

        base_account.gm_list.push(gm);
        base_account.gm_count += 1;

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Account constraints

As we mentioned earlier, the program code itself has no way to access any data, unless the accounts that store that data are passed into the handlers in the context, by the client.

The `Initialize` context struct will look like this:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(init, payer = user, space = 64 + 64)]
    pub base_account: Account<'info, BaseAccount>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

The macro `#[account(init, payer = user, space = 64 + 64)]` basically means that we want to **`init`**ialize the following account (`base_account`), the fee will be paid by `user` below, and we‚Äôll allocate 64KB + 64KB space for it. We need a bigger space because of the vector.

The macro `#[account(mut)]` means that the `user` here will be mutated, because it will be paying fees. This `user` field represents the signer of the transaction, aka. the wallet that called this function.

The last line refers to the root System Program, the special program on Solana that handles account creations. If you leave it out, you won‚Äôt be able to initialize the `base_account` above.

OK, let‚Äôs move on to the `SayGm` struct:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct SayGm<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub base_account: Account<'info, BaseAccount>,
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
}
```

Because we will be mutating the data held in `base_account`, we‚Äôll once again use the `#[account(mut)]` macro.

The most important thing here though is `pub user: Signer<'info>`. This is essentially how we will be able to authenticate, to verify that this address _is_ indeed the one that signed the transaction.

`AccountInfo<'info>` can also represent a user, but there‚Äôs no validation in place that anyone can be an imposter by simply passing in a random account.

What we just did was to do some simple authentication routines completely via writing some Rust types - this is pretty cool and won‚Äôt be possible without Anchor‚Äôs abstraction! This way we can simply use the accounts in our program logic with the guarantee that they have already been checked.

To put everything together, your app should look like this:

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod gm_solana {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> ProgramResult {
        // &mut means we are letting the compiler know that we are mutating this value
        let base_account = &mut ctx.accounts.base_account;

        base_account.gm_count = 0;

        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn say_gm(ctx: Context<SayGm>, message: String) -> ProgramResult {
        let base_account = &mut ctx.accounts.base_account;
        // grab a copy of the input data
        let message = message.clone();
        // get the current Solana network time
        let timestamp = Clock::get().unwrap().unix_timestamp;
        // grab the public key of the user account. We need to use * to dereference the pointer
        let user = *ctx.accounts.user.to_account_info().key;

        let gm = GmMessage {
            user,
            message,
            timestamp,
        };

        base_account.gm_list.push(gm);
        base_account.gm_count += 1;

        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(init, payer = user, space = 64 + 64)]
    pub base_account: Account<'info, BaseAccount>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct SayGm<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub base_account: Account<'info, BaseAccount>,
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
}

#[account]
pub struct BaseAccount {
    pub gm_count: u64,
    pub gm_list: Vec<GmMessage>,
}

// define a struct called GmMessage that contains a message, sender, and timestamp
#[derive(Clone, Debug, AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize)]
pub struct GmMessage {
    pub message: String,
    pub user: Pubkey,
    pub timestamp: i64,
}
```

Done!

### Don‚Äôt forget to compile!

The ‚Äúgm Solana‚Äù program is complete and we need to rebuild the binary. At the same time, in order for our client-side code (be it tests or frontend app) to interact with it, we need to ask Anchor to generate [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) (similar to ABI in EVM), TypeScript types for us.

We can do all this by running `anchor build`.

![anchor build](https://i.imgur.com/zGflmSE.png)

And that‚Äôs it!

## Step 4. Write tests for ‚Äúgm Solana‚Äù

We have already ran the tests for the default ‚Äúhello world‚Äù program, now let‚Äôs update the tests for our ‚Äúgm Solana‚Äù.

Go into `tests/gm-solana.ts` and put in the following, I‚Äôll comment explanation in the code:

```rust
import * as anchor from "@project-serum/anchor";
import { Program } from "@project-serum/anchor";
import { GmSolana } from "../target/types/gm_solana";
import assert from "assert";

// we need to access SystemProgram so that we can create the base_account
const { SystemProgram } = anchor.web3;

describe("gm-solana", () => {
  // configure the client to use the local cluster.
  const provider = anchor.Provider.env();
  anchor.setProvider(provider);

  const program = anchor.workspace.GmSolana as Program<GmSolana>;

  let _baseAccount: anchor.web3.Keypair;

  it("creates a base account for gm's", async () => {
    const baseAccount = anchor.web3.Keypair.generate();
    // call the initialize function via RPC
    const tx = await program.rpc.initialize({
      accounts: {
        baseAccount: baseAccount.publicKey,
        user: provider.wallet.publicKey,
        systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
      },
      signers: [baseAccount],
    });
    // fetch the base account
    const account = await program.account.baseAccount.fetch(
      baseAccount.publicKey
    );

    // gmCount is a "big number" type, so we need to convert it to a string
    assert.equal(account.gmCount.toString(), "0");

    _baseAccount = baseAccount;
  });

  it("receives and saves a gm message", async () => {
    const message = "gm wagmi";
    const user = provider.wallet.publicKey;

    // fetch the base account and cache how many messages are there
    const accountBefore = await program.account.baseAccount.fetch(
      _baseAccount.publicKey
    );
    const gmCountBefore = accountBefore.gmCount;

    // call the sayGm function with message
    const tx = await program.rpc.sayGm(message, {
      accounts: {
        baseAccount: _baseAccount.publicKey,
        user,
      },
    });

    // fetch the base account again and check that the gmCount has increased
    const accountAfter = await program.account.baseAccount.fetch(
      _baseAccount.publicKey
    );
    const gmCountAfter = accountAfter.gmCount;
    assert.equal(gmCountAfter.sub(gmCountBefore).toString(), "1");

    // fetch the gmList and check the value of the first message
    const gmList = accountAfter.gmList;
    assert.equal(gmList[0].message, message);
    assert.equal(gmList[0].user.equals(user), true); // user is an object, we can't just compare objects in JS
    assert.equal(gmList[0].timestamp.gt(new anchor.BN(0)), true); // just a loose check to see if the timestamp is greater than 0
  });
});
```

When finished, the run `anchor test`.

![anchor test](https://i.imgur.com/kHHjlqC.png)

Both tests have passed!

## Step 5. Deploy app to local network

### Set new Program ID

Remember that in the beginning of our code, there‚Äôs that line `declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");`

Now as we are getting closer to production, we need to replace it with the unique Program ID generated by `anchor build`. We can get it with this command:

```rust
solana address -k target/deploy/gm_solana-keypair.json
```

![get gm_solana address](https://i.imgur.com/j5YWfL0.png)

Then, copy this key over back to the `lib.rs` file (use your own pub key pls!):

```rust
declare_id!("9V3sjRVvZ61X4qHkz2gVaxB1kKhMenzjwWhjmhpqgRHK");
```

We‚Äôll also need to update it accordingly in `Anchor.toml`:

```rust
# Anchor.toml
[programs.localnet]
gm-solana = "9V3sjRVvZ61X4qHkz2gVaxB1kKhMenzjwWhjmhpqgRHK"

[provider]
cluster = "localnet"
```

Run `anchor test` again, and it still all works. ;)

![anchor test](https://i.imgur.com/nIRZje0.png)

### Start a local network and deploy

To deploy, we need to start up the `solana-test-validator` in one terminal, and then simply run `anchor deploy` in a new terminal.

![solana-test-validator](https://i.imgur.com/dMc3jDi.png)

![anchor deploy](https://i.imgur.com/pypufxN.png)

Now we have a live deployment, let‚Äôs move on to the last `S` in ASS - Svelte!

## Step 6. Set up frontend

Svelte is an incredibly simple framework/compiler to learn - it‚Äôs just HTML + JavaScript + built-in reactive state management!

If you know nothing about Svelte, I highly recommend you to check out the official [interactive tutorials](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics), it will only take you 15 minutes.

### Set up Svelte

The workspace Anchor generated for us is a monorepo, so we are going to initialize the frontend right inside the `app` directory. Everything from now on is done inside this directory unless notified otherwise.

```bash
cd app
npx degit sveltejs/template .
node scripts/setupTypeScript.js

yarn
```

![Set up Svelte](https://i.imgur.com/FY3Gfyv.png)

As mentioned in the very beginning, we will need to install a bunch of client-side JavaScript libraries to interact with the blockchain:

```bash
yarn add @project-serum/anchor @solana/web3.js
```

### Configure Rollup

We need some extra steps to get the Rollup bundler do its job correctly.

Just like how our tests worked, we need the IDL files for our Svelte app so that it knows which instruction handlers exist on our Solana program, as well as the data type of everything.

The IDL files and types are located under the `target` directory under the Anchor project root. Just copy the entire `target/idl` and `target/types` directory over into `app/src/idl` and `app/src/types`. In our case, we only have one `gm_solana.json` and one `gm_solana.ts` file.

We will also need to enable JSON module resolving in `app/tsconfig.json`. It will look like this:

```json
{
  "extends": "@tsconfig/svelte/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "resolveJsonModule": true
  },

  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules/*", "__sapper__/*", "public/*"]
}
```

And now we need to install a few plugins. These take care of JSON imports and polyfilling built-in Node.js modules not available in the browser.

```bash
yarn add -D @rollup/plugin-json rollup-plugin-node-builtins rollup-plugin-node-globals
```

Then enable them in `rollup.config.js`:

```svelte
// ... other imports
import json from "@rollup/plugin-json";
import builtins from "rollup-plugin-node-builtins";
import globals from "rollup-plugin-node-globals";

export default {
  // ... other configs
  plugins: [
    // ... other rollup plugins
    resolve({
      browser: true,
      dedupe: ["svelte"],
      preferBuiltins: false, // set this to false
    }),
    // ... more rollup plugins
    json(),
    globals(),
    builtins(),
  ]
};
```

Now we can start the dev server with:

```bash
yarn dev
```

![yarn dev](https://i.imgur.com/T0N8323.png)

![Svelte Hello World](https://i.imgur.com/EFUhZOa.png)

### Create a ‚ÄúConnect Wallet‚Äù button

When a user visits our dApp, the first thing they need to do should be to connect their Phantom Wallet with our app. What exactly this does is that the browser extension injects into our page a ‚Äúprovider‚Äù, which our app can use to interact with the blockchain on behalf of the user (of course the user needs to approve and sign any transactions). We will make a ‚Äúconnect wallet‚Äù button for them.

This is essentially the same as when you are already logged into Google or Github, and now want to connect to a third party service using the ‚ÄúSign in with Google‚Äù button.

Let‚Äôs clean up the default page Svelte generated for us and implement this thing, I added comments to highlight important lines:

```html
<script lang="ts">
  import { onMount } from "svelte";

  // ======== APPLICATION STATE ========

  let wallet: any;
  let account = "";

  // reactively log the wallet connection when account state changes,
  // if you don't know what this is, check out https://svelte.dev/tutorial/reactive-declarations
  $: account && console.log(`Connected to wallet: ${account}`);

  // ======== PAGE LOAD CHECKS ========

  const onLoad = async () => {
    const { solana } = window as any;
    wallet = solana;

    // set up handlers for wallet events
    wallet.on("connect", () => (account = wallet.publicKey.toString()));
    wallet.on("disconnect", () => (account = ""));

    // eagerly connect wallet if the user already has connected before, otherwise do nothing
    const resp = await wallet.connect({ onlyIfTrusted: true });
  };

  // life cycle hook for when the component is mounted
  onMount(() => {
    // run the onLoad function when the page completes loading

Let‚Äôs open up the app again in the browser, and voil√†!

### Switch to local network

By default, the Phantom Wallet connects to the mainnet of Solana. Since we are doing all the testing on local network, you need to go to Settings then Change Network to _localhost_.

## Step 7. Implement guest book frontend

Now let‚Äôs write the core features of the app. The app should display a list of ‚Äúgm‚Äù messages, tagged with their timestamps and the wallet address of their senders.

We‚Äôve already interacted with the Solana network before - in the tests! Now we just need to do something similar.

### Connection helpers to the Solana network

To get started, we need to have a bunch of parameters at our disposal, namely the `programID`, which `network` we are interacting with, and some `connection` settings with some handy context providers.

Add this to the existing code in `App.svelte`:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  // ...
  import * as idl from "./idl/gm_solana.json";
  import type { GmSolana } from "./types/gm_solana";
  import { Connection, PublicKey, clusterApiUrl } from "@solana/web3.js";
  import { Idl, Program, Provider, web3 } from "@project-serum/anchor";
  const { SystemProgram, Keypair } = web3;

  //...

  // ======== CONNECT TO NETWORK ========

  // get program id from IDL, the metadata is only available after a deployment
  const programID = new PublicKey(idl.metadata.address);

  // we are using local network endpoint for now
  const network = "http://127.0.0.1:8899";

  // set up connection with "preflight commitment" set to "confirmed" level, which basically means that our app
  // will treat the transaction as done only when the block is voted on by supermajority.
  // this is similar to waiting for how many confirmations like in Ethereum.
  // you can also set it to "finalized" (even more secure) or "processed" (changes might be rolled back)
  const connection = new Connection(network, "confirmed");

  // create a network and wallet context provider
  const getProvider = () => {
    const provider = new Provider(connection, wallet, {
      preflightCommitment: "confirmed",
    });
    return provider;
  };

  // helper function to get the program
  const getProgram = () => {
    const program = new Program(
      idl as Idl,
      programID,
      getProvider()
    ) as Program<GmSolana>;
    return program;
  };
</script>
```

### Initialize Base Account

Now comes the interesting part. Remember that our app needs a base account to store all the gm messages?

Well, everyone can create their base account and they are all perfectly valid - it‚Äôs like that everyone can set up a private Minecraft server. If you insist having a singleton design for your base account, you will need to hardcode the user accounts that are allowed to create them in your program.

So, in our ‚Äúgm Solana‚Äù app, the visitors will be given two choices - to initialize a new base account or use a pre-existing one. If you want to host your ‚Äúultimate, canonical, official gm Solana‚Äù app, you can just bake your base account into the Svelte code.

This is pretty cool isn‚Äôt it? ;)

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  // ...
  // ======== INITIATE BASE ACCOUNT ========

  // the base account that will hold the gm messages,
  // if we want to share the same "gm Solana" instance then we need to provide the same base account
  let baseAccountPublicKey: PublicKey;
  let baseAccountPublicKeyInput = ""; // UI state used for the input field

  // because state in Solana is not tied with programs, users can create their own "baseAccount" for the gm app,
  // the way to share and establish our baseAccount as the "official" one is to provide users with ours up front
  // in the app client. otherwise we can also hardcode a "deployer account" in the program so only it can do it.
  // the initializeAccount() here is a naive implementation that creates a new baseAccount on demand.
  const initializeAccount = async () => {
    const provider = getProvider();
    const program = getProgram();
    const _baseAccount = Keypair.generate();
    Keypair;

    await program.rpc.initialize({
      accounts: {
        baseAccount: _baseAccount.publicKey,
        user: provider.wallet.publicKey,
        systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
      },
      signers: [_baseAccount],
    });
    baseAccountPublicKey = _baseAccount.publicKey;
    console.log("New BaseAccount:", baseAccountPublicKey.toString());
    await getGmList(); // first fetch
  };

  // alternative to initializeAccount(), loadAccount() allows you to pick up a previously created baseAccount
  // so we can share the same "gm Solana" instance!
  const loadAccount = async () => {
    baseAccountPublicKey = new PublicKey(baseAccountPublicKeyInput);
    console.log("Loaded BaseAccount:", baseAccountPublicKey.toString());
    await getGmList(); // first fetch
  };
</script>
<main>
  <!-- other stuff... -->
  {#if account}
    {#if !baseAccountPublicKey}
      <button on:click={initializeAccount}>Initialize account</button>
      or
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="use existing account..."
        bind:value={baseAccountPublicKeyInput}
      />
      <button on:click={loadAccount}>Load</button>
    {:else}
      Using gm solana base account: {baseAccountPublicKey.toString()}
    {/if}
  {/if}
</main>
```

### Interact with the program

Now we are all set to interact with the blockchain and wire up local state! We‚Äôll set up a couple of extra UI state variables and render all the gm‚Äôs neatly in a list. Of course there‚Äôs also a submit button.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  // ...
  // ======== APPLICATION STATE ========
  // ... other state
  let gmList = [];
  let gmMessage = "";

  // ======== PROGRAM INTERACTION ========

  // interacts with our program and updates local the gm list
  const getGmList = async () => {
    const program = getProgram();
    const account = await program.account.baseAccount.fetch(
      baseAccountPublicKey
    );

    console.log("Got the account", account);
    gmList = account.gmList as any[];
  };

  // interacts with our program and submits a new gm message
  const sayGm = async () => {
    const provider = getProvider();
    const program = getProgram();

    await program.rpc.sayGm(gmMessage, {
      accounts: {
        baseAccount: baseAccountPublicKey,
        user: provider.wallet.publicKey,
      },
      // if we don't supply a signer, it will try to use the connected wallet by default
    });
    console.log("gm successfully sent", gmMessage);
    gmMessage = ""; // clears the input field

    await getGmList(); // updates the local gm list
  };

  $: console.log("gmList:", gmList); // just some extra logging when the gm list changes
</script>
<main>
  <!-- other stuff... -->
  {#if baseAccountPublicKey}
    <div>
      <h3>gm List:</h3>
      <ul>
        {#each gmList as gm}
          <li>
            <b>{gm.message}</b>, said {gm.user.toString().slice(0, 6)}... at {new Date(
              gm.timestamp.toNumber() * 1000
            ).toLocaleTimeString()}
          </li>
        {/each}
      </ul>
      <button on:click={getGmList}>Refresh gms!</button>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Say gm:</h3>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="write something..."
        bind:value={gmMessage}
      />
      <button on:click={sayGm} disabled={!gmMessage}>Say gm!</button>
    </div>
  {/if}
</main>
```

If your browser wallet doesn‚Äôt have local network SOL tokens, you can always airdrop yourself a bunch:

```svelte
solana airdrop 1000 mmmmyyyyywwwwwaaaalllleeeetttt
```

![Airdrop](https://i.imgur.com/PdCEQaf.png)

And that‚Äôs it, we have finished the ‚Äúgm Solana‚Äù dApp! Have fun playing with it in the browser.

![Final demo](https://i.imgur.com/oWh5iOf.png)

## Step 8. Deploy on public devnet (or mainnet)

So far we‚Äôve only been deploying to localhost running the test validator. To deploy it to devnet (or mainnet-beta), you need a few extra steps.

### Update tooling configs

First, you need to switch the Solana CLI to devnet.

```bash
solana config set --url devnet
solana config get
```

Then, open the `Anchor.toml` file in project root to update the `cluster` and `[programs.localnet]`:

```bash
# Anchor.toml
[programs.devnet]
gm-solana = "foooooooobaaaaaaar"

[provider]
cluster = "devnet"
```

If you don‚Äôt have devnet SOL, you can airdrop yourself 5 at a time.

```bash
solana airdrop 5 mmmmyyyyywwwwwaaaalllleeeetttt
```

Then, you can run build and deploy again!

```bash
anchor build
anchor deploy
```

### Update parameters in app

Since we are deploying to the public devnet, you will need to switch the network in Phantom Wallet to devnet of course.

Then, you only need to change one thing in the app:

```svelte
<script lang=ts>
  // ...
  // // we are using local network endpoint for now
  // const network = "http://127.0.0.1:8899";

  // we are using devnet endpoint
  const network = clusterApiUrl('devnet');
</script>
```

Run `yarn dev` or `yarn build` in the `app` directory again, and you are all set!

## That‚Äôs bad ASS!

Now you have mastered the art of ASS appreciation, you are an ASS stack connoisseur!
